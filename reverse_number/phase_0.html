			<h1>Reverse number with different approaches in many programming languages: Phase 0</h1>

			<h3>Why does this topic exists ?</h3>
			<p>
				I have been practising coding for about 4 years until the day this blog
				published. Learning many programming languages, solving many(maybe)
				problems, reading many others' code, etc. Yup, pretty much many things
				to say before getting to say why I write this topic, so let's cut
				the flow a little bit. If you don't know yet what does it mean by 
				`reverse number`, you can see <a href = "#definition">this.</a>
				From now, I will assume that you know what that means. OK! Let's get to 
				work. Before, to reverse number, we often using
				<a href = "#arithmetic">Arithmetic method</a>.
				Then, one sunny morning, I woke up and thought, is there other way to 
				perform the same task but less
				<span style = "background-color:grey">numbers' manipulation</span>
				, that is when I came up with <a href = "#string">new approach.</a>
			</p>

			<h4>Oh, really!. Don't bit around the bush, just get to the point. Why you 
			write this blog?</h4>

			<p>
				Well, the point is I want to record the way of how I achieved the new 
				method to (old) problems. Secondly, someone need to write a blog about
				this topic so that everyone accidentally meet this blog knows that there
				are many many ways to approach the problems.
			</p>

			<h3 id = "definition">What does it mean by reverse number?</h3>
			<p>
				OK!. That's a big question. I mean, not by its size or difficulties, but
				by its importance to guide us what to do. Sometimes, before coding(and 
				probably doing anything else), you need to know <b>what to do</b>(For
				real, it's vitally important). Enough distraction, let's get to real work.
				Reverse number by making the number <b>reversed</b>(It does sound like a
				recursive definition because it's obvious, how do I suppose to explain 
				something obvious). Let's look at some example, shall we?
			</p>
			<code>
				Reverse(123456) -> 654321 <br/>
				Reverse(9878) -> 8798 <br/>
				Reverse(1) -> 1
			</code>
			<p>
				I hope you get the idea now because to read the rest of this blog, it's 
				required to understand <b>what does `reverse number` do</b>. Let's try
				another example to see if you are totally understand it. Press the button
				to show the answer(but let's make a guess first).
			</p>
			<p>
				Reverse number is like <b>MIRROR</b>ing them.
			</p>
			<img src = "a.jpg" alt = "Some picture about mirror"/>
			<div class = "interactive">
				<p id = "1">Reverse(98756) -> <span id = "answer_1">?</span></p>
				<button onclick="document.getElementById('answer_1').innerHTML=65789;">Show</button>
				<p id = "2">Reverse(10000000000000) -> <span id = "answer_2">?</span></p>
				<button onclick="document.getElementById('answer_2').innerHTML=1;">Show</button>
				<p id = "3">Reverse(000000000000001) -> <span id = "answer_3">?</span></p>
				<button onclick="document.getElementById('answer_3').innerHTML=1;">Show</button>
			</div>
			<p>
				For example 1, it does sound simple, right? But what about example 2 and 
				3, if the answer 1 surprises you. Well, you're not alone. Keep reading to
				see to find the reason.
			</p>

			<h3>What is the "old approach" to reverse a number ?</h3>

			<p>
				Before introducing the "old approach", let's first look at the number from
				the mathematic lens.<br/>
				12345 = 10000 + 2000 + 300 + 40 + 5<br/>
				This can be intepreted more under the combination of 10 multiplers<br/>
				12345 = 1*10^4 + 2*10^3 + 3*10^2 + 4*10^1 + 5*10^0<br/>
				From the idea observed from the len of mathematician, we see that every
				unsigned integer can always be represented under the combination of 10
				multiplers.
				Now, let's look at <b>what we have to do</b>. To reverse number, for 
				example, 12345, it's must become 54321, which mean that<br/>
				12345 = 1*10^4 + 2*10^3 + 3*10^2 + 4*10^1 + 5*10^0<br/>
				Now, become<br/>
				54321 = 5*10^4 + 4*10^3 + 3*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 1*10^0<br/>
				At first, it's <span style = "background:grey">1*10^4</span>, later, it
				become <span style = "background:grey">5*10^4</span>, and so on.

			<p>
				As eye can discern, each individual digit is multiplied with 10 to the 
				power of column number. With little help with divide(/) and modulus(%)
				we can get the digit then multiply it with corresponding column.
			</p>

			<p>
				We will use small number here so a demostration, let's say 123. Now, we
				need to get the last number(it's number 3). Using modulus, we get<br/>
				<span style = "background:grey">3 = 123 % 10</span><br/>
				OK, that good, we now need to get number 2. Let's use modulus again, this
				time % 100 will give us 2. Wait a minute, it's really 2. Let's try it, 
				shall we?<br/>
				<span style = "background:grey">123 % 100 = 23(that's not 2)</span><br/>
				At this moment, our hypothesis seems to be wrong, isn't it?<br/>
				<span style = "background:grey">123 = 100 + 23.</span><br/>
				Therefore, % 100 will result in 23. But how about 120.
				<span style = "background:grey">120 % 100 = 20.</span><br/>
				Yup, it doesn't work, either. But wait, we got 20, 20 / 10 = 2. This is
				the moment of truth.<br/>
				<span style = "background:grey">
					(123 - 3) = 120<br/>
					120 % 100 = 20<br/>
					20 / 10 = 2<br/>
				</span>
				It seems like a long step to deal with when it come to number 1.<br/>
				<span style = "background:grey">((123 - 20 - 3) % 1000) / 10 = 1</span>
				Yup, pretty long way, and we have to deal with 1000, what if the number 
				is 1234567890987, how many power of 10 do we have to deal with. I think
				now we should use the power of computer. Let's say I have a power 
				function named `floor`. floor(12.5) = 12, floor(4.0) = 4. This function
				return the integer part of any real number. Now, our method will be 
				reduced to just a few lines with small number.
				<span style = "background: grey">
					floor(123 / 10) % 10 = floor(12.3) % 10 = 12 % 10 = 2
				</span><br/>
				That's cool, but what about, number 1. Well, let's said it now, we change
				our mind, we don't need to reverse number 123, we just need 12
				(=floor(123 / 10)). Getting 1 is just 1=floor(12 / 10) % 10. Simple, 
				right?
			</p>

			<p>
				Up until now, we already figure out how to get each digit individually.
				Let's summarize it:
				<span style = "background: grey">
					3 = 123 % 10
					2 = floor(123 / 10) % 10
					1 = floor(floor(123 / 10) / 10) % 10
				</span><br/>
				Pretty simple, right? Now, in order to get 321, which mean 3*100 + 2*10+1
				You may now recognize some similarities between the number of zeroes
				behind 1 equal to number of missing `floor`. Well, it's little vague, 
				allow me to elaborate it for you. Number 1 has 2 `floor` appears 
				according to the formula above, and that two `floor` is the biggest
				number of floor of the three numbers(1,2,3). Therefore, we mark 1 as
				standard, number 3 has 0 `floor`, it's missing 2 floors, which means
				it need 2 zeroes(100); on the other hand, 2 has 1 `floor`, missing 1
				so it has 1 zero(10) and last but not least, 1 has 2 `floor`, missing 0
				so it has 0 zero(1).
			</p>

			<p>
				I hope I have explained enough about the workhorse of `reverse number`
				in mathematics concept. Now it's time for some codes.
			</p>
			<pre><code class = "javascript">
var sum = 0;
var digit = 0;
var num = 321;
while (num != 0) {
	digit = num % 10;
	sum = sum * 10 + digit;
	num = Math.floor(num / 10);
}				
			</code></pre>
			<p>
				The code is self-explanatory itself. However, it's a little bit different
				from the mathematics way. Let me crack the code into a much familiar way.
				First, we have some declaration of variable. A digit and sum, and default value of num = 321. Then we go to the while loop. The condition
				here to execute the while-loop body is the num must be different from 0. 
				At start, we assume num is 321; therefore, obviously, `num != 0` must be
				true. Then we get the number 1 by `num % 10`, after that, we take `sum * 
				10 + digit`, which is `0*10+1` = 1 => sum now is 1. Last but not least, 
				we divide num by 10, which results in 32.1 and flooring it to get 32 =>
				num is now equals 32. After the whole while-loop body is executed, we go
				back to check the condition `num != 0`, which turns out to be true, and
				we repeat the whole process again with value of `num = 32`.
			</p>
			<p>
				The table below record all the values of `num`, `sum` and `digit`
				accordings to the number of while-loop executed.
			</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Number of loop</th>
					<th>num</th>
					<th>sum</th>
					<th>digit</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>321</td>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>0</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>

					<td>1</td>

					<td>3</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

				And that is the old approach to reverse number. Pretty cool, right?
