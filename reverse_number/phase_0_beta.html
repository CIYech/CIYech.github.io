            <p>
                I have been practising coding for about 4 years until the day this blog
                published. Learning many programming languages, solving many(maybe)
                problems, reading many others' code, etc. Yup, pretty much many things
                to say before getting to say why I write this topic, so let's cut
                the flow a little bit. If you don't know yet what does it mean by
                'reverse number', you can see <a href="#definition"><font color="red">this.</font></a>
                From now, I will assume that you know what that means. OK! Let's get to
                work. Before, to reverse number, we often using
                <a href="#arithmetic"><font color="red">Arithmetic method</font></a>.
                Then, one sunny morning, I woke up and thought, is there other way to
                perform the same task but less
                <span style="background-color:yellow">numbers' manipulation</span>
                , that is when I came up with <a href="#string"><font color="red">new approach.</font></a>
            </p>

            <h4>
                Oh, really!. Don't bit around the bush, just get to the point. Why you
                write this blog?
            </h4>

            <p>
                Well, the point is I want to record the way of how I achieved the new
                method to (old) problems. Secondly, someone need to write a blog about
                this topic so that everyone accidentally meet this blog knows that there
                are many many ways to approach the problems.

                OK!. That's a big question. I mean, not by its size or difficulties, but
                by its importance to guide us what to do. Sometimes, before coding(and
                probably doing anything else), you need to know <b>what to do</b>(For
                real, it's vitally important). Enough distraction, let's get to real work.
                Reverse number by making the number <b>reversed</b>(It does sound like a
                recursive definition because it's obvious, how do I suppose to explain
                something obvious). Let's look at some example, shall we?
            </p>
            <code>
                Reverse(123456) -> 654321 <br />
                Reverse(9878) -> 8798 <br />
                Reverse(1) -> 1
            </code>
            <p>
                I hope you get the idea now because to read the rest of this blog, it's
                required to understand <b>what does 'reverse number' do</b>. Let's try
                another example to see if you are totally understand it. Press the button
                to show the answer(but let's make a guess first).
            </p>
            <p>
                Reverse number is like <b>MIRROR</b>ing them.
            </p>
            <img src="a.jpg" alt="Some picture about mirror" />
            <div class="interactive">
                <p id="1">Reverse(98756) -> <span id="answer_1">?</span></p>
                <button onclick="document.getElementById('answer_1').innerHTML=65789;">Show</button>
                <p id="2">Reverse(10000000000000) -> <span id="answer_2">?</span></p>
                <button onclick="document.getElementById('answer_2').innerHTML=1;">Show</button>
                <p id="3">Reverse(000000000000001) -> <span id="answer_3">?</span></p>
                <button onclick="document.getElementById('answer_3').innerHTML=1;">Show</button>
            </div>
            <p>
                For example 1, it does sound simple, right? But what about example 2 and
                3, if the answer 1 surprises you. Well, you're not alone. Keep reading to
                see to find the reason.

            <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
            <p>
                Before introducing the "old approach", let's first look at the number from
                the mathematic lens.<br />
                12345 = 10000 + 2000 + 300 + 40 + 5<br />
                This can be intepreted more under the combination of 10 multiplers<br />
                12345 = 1*10^4 + 2*10^3 + 3*10^2 + 4*10^1 + 5*10^0<br />
                From the idea observed from the len of mathematician, we see that every
                unsigned integer can always be represented under the combination of 10
                multiplers.
                Now, let's look at <b>what we have to do</b>. To reverse number, for
                example, 12345, it's must become 54321, which mean that<br />
                12345 = 1*10^4 + 2*10^3 + 3*10^2 + 4*10^1 + 5*10^0<br />
                Now, become<br />
                54321 = 5*10^4 + 4*10^3 + 3*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 1*10^0<br />
                At first, it's <span style="background:yellow">1*10^4</span>, later, it
                become <span style="background:yellow">5*10^4</span>, and so on.
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Column</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>1</td>

            <p>
                As eye can discern, each individual digit is multiplied with 10 to the
                power of column number. With little help with divide(/) and modulus(%)
                we can get the digit then multiply it with corresponding column.
            </p>

            <p>
                We will use small number here so a demostration, let's say 123. Now, we
                need to get the last number(it's number 3). Using modulus, we get<br />
                <span style="background:yellow">3 = 123 % 10</span><br />
                OK, that good, we now need to get number 2. Let's use modulus again, this
                time % 100 will give us 2. Wait a minute, it's really 2. Let's try it,
                shall we?<br />
                <span style="background:yellow">123 % 100 = 23(that's not 2)</span><br />
                At this moment, our hypothesis seems to be wrong, isn't it?<br />
                <span style="background:yellow">123 = 100 + 23.</span><br />
                Therefore, % 100 will result in 23. But how about 120.
                <span style="background:yellow">120 % 100 = 20.</span><br />
                Yup, it doesn't work, either. But wait, we got 20, 20 / 10 = 2. This is
                the moment of truth.<br />
                <span style="background:yellow">
                    (123 - 3) = 120<br />
                    120 % 100 = 20<br />
                    20 / 10 = 2<br />
                </span>
                It seems like a long step to deal with when it come to number 1.<br />
                <span style="background:yellow">((123 - 20 - 3) % 1000) / 10 = 1</span>
                Yup, pretty long way, and we have to deal with 1000, what if the number
                is 1234567890987, how many power of 10 do we have to deal with. I think
                now we should use the power of computer. Let's say I have a power
                function named 'floor'. floor(12.5) = 12, floor(4.0) = 4. This function
                return the integer part of any real number. Now, our method will be
                reduced to just a few lines with small number.
                <span style="background: yellow">
                    floor(123 / 10) % 10 = floor(12.3) % 10 = 12 % 10 = 2
                </span><br />
                That's cool, but what about, number 1. Well, let's said it now, we change
                our mind, we don't need to reverse number 123, we just need <br /> 12
                (=floor(123 / 10)). Getting 1 is just 1=floor(12 / 10) % 10. Simple,
                right?
            </p>

            <p>
                Up until now, we already figure out how to get each digit individually.
                Let's summarize it:
                <br />
                <span style="background:yellow">
                    3 = 123 % 10
                    2 = floor(123 / 10) % 10
                    1 = floor(floor(123 / 10) / 10) % 10
                </span><br />
                Pretty simple, right? Now, in order to get 321, which mean 3*100 + 2*10+1
                You may now recognize some similarities between the number of zeroes
                behind 1 equal to number of missing 'floor'. Well, it's little vague,
                allow me to elaborate it for you. Number 1 has 2 'floor' appears
                according to the formula above, and that two 'floor' is the biggest
                number of floor of the three numbers(1,2,3). Therefore, we mark 1 as
                standard, number 3 has 0 'floor', it's missing 2 floors, which means
                it need 2 zeroes(100); on the other hand, 2 has 1 'floor', missing 1
                so it has 1 zero(10) and last but not least, 1 has 2 'floor', missing 0
                so it has 0 zero(1).

                I hope I have explained enough about the workhorse of `reverse number`
                in mathematics concept. Now it's time for some codes.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
var sum = 0;
var digit = 0;
var num = 321;
while (num != 0) {
	digit = num % 10;
	sum = sum * 10 + digit;
	num = Math.floor(num / 10);
}				
			</code></pre>
            <p>
                The code is self-explanatory itself. However, it's a little bit different
                from the mathematics way. Let me crack the code into a much familiar way.
                First, we have some declaration of variable. A digit and sum, and default value of num = 321. Then we go to the while loop. The condition
                here to execute the while-loop body is the num must be different from 0.
                At start, we assume num is 321; therefore, obviously, 'num != 0' must be true. 
                Then we get the number 1 by 'num % 10', after that, we take 'sum * 10 + digit', which is '0*10+1' = 1 => sum now is 1. 
                Last but not least, we divide num by 10, which results in 32.1 and flooring it to get 32 => num is now equals 32. 
                After the whole while-loop body is executed, we go back to check the condition 'num != 0', which turns out to be true, and
                we repeat the whole process again with value of 'num = 32'.
            </p>
            <p>
                The table below record all the values of 'num', 'sum' and 'digit' accordings to the number of while-loop executed.
